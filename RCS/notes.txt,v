@when tst/!=src/ then i can not do a: class Foo { public static void main(String[] argument) throws Exception { FooTestCase.main(new String[0]); } } since it can not find the FooTestCase :(

seems to be working using getting files and properties rescource bundles from jar

integrate this with junit now in ant!

currently blowing on line 47 of the build file with a can not file class l test case?@
